# Bitwise

*What I cannot create, I do not understand.*
- Richard Feynman

## Overview

I dislike the idea of not understanding how something works, and this is especially the case for 
something like a CPU. The main purpose of this project is to allow me to better understand
how a microprocessor functions and operates. Starting almost from scratch, with basic logic gates, 
the eventual goal is to create a full-fledged microprocessor in software. I have no idea what that 
will look like, nor do I know how much work it will be, nor do I even have a clue whether or not 
such a thing is even possible or I'm just speaking nonsense. If nothing else, this will serve as an 
insight for me as I learn about computer hardware and digital systems in my classes.

This project takes inspiration from several sources, the largest of which (quite literally) is the 
[megaprocessor](http://www.megaprocessor.com/). This is a microprocessor built from large 
transistors instead of tiny ones, which allows someone to glance inside the operations carried out
by the processor and appreciate the intricacies and complexities of such a system.

Even if I don't accomplish the end goal, this project might serve useful to others. By itself, it
can be used as a framework for creating simple digital logic circuits in software.

## Done

* Gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR)
* Multiplexers and demultiplexers
* Encoders and decoders
* Seven-segment converters
* Half- and full- adders
* Misc logic circuits (majority, parity generators, etc.)
